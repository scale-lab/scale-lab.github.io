### Efficient machine learning processing for resource-constrained embedded and wearable devices
Funding: NSF, DoD and Facebook\
Members: Abdelrahman Hosny, Marina Neseem, Ahmed Agiza\
Collaborators:\

**MLCompiler**: Lorem ipsum

**Graph NP-Hard Problems**: Many NP-hard problems can be modeled as a graph. They appear any many application domains such as VLSI, cloud computing, social networks, and computational biology. In this project, Abdelrahman is investigating the question: can Reinforcement Learning on Graph-based environments offer alternative solutions to traditional heuristics-based algorithms? In other words, is it possible that graph heuristics can be learned and improved over time?

**Migrating EDA Applications to the Cloud**: Cloud computing accelerates design space exploration in logic synthesis, and parameter tuning in physical design.
However, deploying EDA jobs on the cloud requires EDA teams to deeply understand the characteristics of their jobs in cloud environments. In [this work](https://github.com/scale-lab/EDAonCloud), Abdelrahman has studied the performance of EDA applications when launched in a cloud-like environment. He proposed an ML-based framework that reduces cloud deployment costs up to 35.29%.

**Adaptive Low Power Sensing**: Lorem ipsum

**Logic Synthesis Optimization**: Logic synthesis requires extensive tuning of the synthesis optimization flow where the quality of results (QoR) depends on the sequence of optimizations used. Efficient design space exploration is challenging due to the exponential number of possible optimization permutations. In [this project](https://github.com/scale-lab/DRiLLS), Abdelrahman modeled the logic synthesis optimization problem as an MDP (Markov Decision Process), and used Reinforcement Learning to provide a sequence of optimization commands that achieves outperforming QoR.
