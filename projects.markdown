### Efficient machine learning processing for resource-constrained embedded and wearable devices
Funding: NSF, DoD and Facebook\
Members: Abdelrahman Hosny, Marina Neseem, Ahmed Agiza\
Collaborators:\

**MLCompiler**: Lorem ipsum

**Graph NP-Hard Problems**: Many NP-hard problems can be modeled as a graph. They appear any many application domains such as VLSI, cloud computing, social networks, and computational biology. In this project, Abdelrahman is investigating the question: can Reinforcement Learning on Graph-based environments offer alternative solutions to traditional heuristics-based algorithms? In other words, is it possible that graph heuristics can be learned and improved over time?

**Migrating EDA Applications to the Cloud**: Cloud computing accelerates design space exploration in logic synthesis, and parameter tuning in physical design.
However, deploying EDA jobs on the cloud requires EDA teams to deeply understand the characteristics of their jobs in cloud environments. In [this work](https://github.com/scale-lab/EDAonCloud), Abdelrahman has studied the performance of EDA applications when launched in a cloud-like environment. He proposed an ML-based framework that reduces cloud deployment costs up to 35.29%.

**Adaptive Context-Aware Object Detection for Embedded Devices**: With the advancement in Augmented Reality and Smart Glasses, Object Detection became an essential task for Edge Devices. However, STOA object detectors have large compute and memory footprints challenging their deployment on edge devices. In recent work, Marina has explored leveraging the prior knowledge about the probabilities that different object categories can occur jointly to increase the efficiency of object detection models. Her results shows 25% reduction in energy and memory footprint with a negligible loss in accuracy.

**Low-Power Sensing for Human Activity Recognition on Wearable Devices**: Wearable devices have strict power and memory limitations. As a result, there is a need to optimize the power consumption on those devices without sacrificing the accuracy. In [AdaSense](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9218568), Marina built a sensing, feature extraction and classification co-optimized framework for Human Activity Recognition. AdaSense dynamically adjusts the sampling freuency of the sensor based on the user activity, which reduces the power consumption by up to 69%. Beyond Human Activity Recognition, the idea of dynamic sampling used in AdaSense can be applied to other applications involving different biometric sensors, cameras, etc.

**Logic Synthesis Optimization**: Logic synthesis requires extensive tuning of the synthesis optimization flow where the quality of results (QoR) depends on the sequence of optimizations used. Efficient design space exploration is challenging due to the exponential number of possible optimization permutations. In [this project](https://github.com/scale-lab/DRiLLS), Abdelrahman modeled the logic synthesis optimization problem as an MDP (Markov Decision Process), and used Reinforcement Learning to provide a sequence of optimization commands that achieves outperforming QoR.

### Thermal & power sensing, modeling and management for mobile SoCs
Funding: NSF and Samsung\
Members: Sofiane Chetoui\
Collaborators: Ayse Coskun\

Mobile devices have become an essential part of daily life with the increased computing capabilities and features. However, their limited cooling capabilities makes thermal management a critical factor in determining performance limits. Additionally, mobile devices are battery powered devices, which raises power and battery management challenges. Sofiane have been working on proposing control techniques using modeling and machine learning to manage the different sources of power and thermal emergencies, in order to provide the best performance while respecting the phone specifications. Furthermore, he proposed a workload- and user-aware batterry lifetime management technique to improve the user experience by maximizing the performance while meeting the user desired battery lifetime.
