Andrew Duncombe is a senior undergraduate student pursuing a BSc in Computer Engineering. His research focuses on the implementation of embedded deep learning neural networks using spiking neurons architectures, and the design of novel approaches to performing digital arithmetic. He is interested in designing architectures that make the implementation of complex computing processes, like neural networks, feasible for real-world applications.
