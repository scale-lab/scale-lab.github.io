Jingxiao is a first-year Ph.D student in the School of Engineering. He received his BSc degree of Computer Science from University of Nottingham in 2018, and MSc degree from Brown University in 2020. He is interested in approximate logic synthesis using deep learning approaches. He was previously working on large-scale approximate computing with boolean matrix factorization (BLASYS). Now he focuses on the connection between neural networks and logic synthesis, and using deep learning architectures to improve approximate computing.
