Jingxiao is a second-year ScM student in the Computer Science department. He received his bachelorï¿½s degree from University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom in 2018. He is interested in approximate computing methods and machine learning. He is now working on large-scale approximate computing with boolean matrix factorization (BMF). He implements a greedy design-space exploration flow, which applies BMF algorithm to large-scale circuits. In the future, he would like to dig into the area of approximate computing and optimize design with more algorithmic techniques.
