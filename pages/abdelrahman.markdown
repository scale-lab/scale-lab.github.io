Abdelrahman is a PhD Candidate in the Computer Science department. He mixes software industry experience with his research to reimagine the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) landscape. His PhD research tries to make silicon compilation catch up with advances in software compilation: free, open source and easy to use. Towards that goal, he investigates machine learning techniques (specifically Reinforcement Learning) for optimizing EDA flows with no human in-loop. Abdelrahman received a Master's in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Connecticut, and a Bachelor in Computer Science from Assiut University.
