Sofiane is a fourth-year PhD student in the School of Engineering. His research tries to improve energy efficiency, thermal behavior and performance of mobile devices through runtime management. He is interested in thermal/power and hardware characterization and modeling of modern Mobile SoCs when stressed by compute intensive workloads, including Graphacis and Augmented Reality applications. He uses control theory and machine learning to design the next generation of thermal and power management techniques. His reasearch focuses as well on providing a better user-experience and battery lifetime management for Mobile Devices. He received his Master degree in Electronics from Ecole National Polytechnic in Algeria, and a Master degree in Computer and Electrical Engineering from Brown University.
