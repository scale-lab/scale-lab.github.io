[Bahaa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bahaaaldeen/) is a Visiting Research Fellow at Scalable Energy-Efficient Computing Laboratory(SCALE) for the year 2020. He has been a Graduate Research Assistant at the Nano-electronics Integrated Systems Center(NISC), Nile University, in Egypt, since 2017. He is currently the National Point of contact in Egypt for the Space Generation Advisory Council (SGAC). He is also a Co-founder of the Association of Youth Researchers for Innovation and Development ([AYRID](https://ayrid.org/pages/about.html)). He has received the IEEE Golden Prize (First Place) for power and control section at the Egyptian Engineering Day, in 2014 ([EED 2014](http://eed.eg/Articles/EED14Awards)).


He was a part of an initiative with the Institute of Space Systems (IRS), University of Stuttgart, Germany, to design a concept project for a manned space mission to Venus as an EPS Engineer, under the sponsorship of the European Space Agency (ESA). He has served as a part of an environmental initiative collaborating with IIT Bombay, India, to design electrical vehicles for public transportation, in 2014.


He has a number of [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eEgJwR4AAAAJ&hl=en) in high impact journals in the field of chaos theory, fractional order systems, Nano/Micro-electronics, Optimization Techniques, FPGA/ASIC design flow and Nano-robotics. He also acted as a reviewer for the IEEE ACCESS journal in 2019 and the Circuits, Systems, and Signal Processing journal in 2020. He is currently working on using Fractional order calculus and Fractional order systems for feature extraction in machine learning recognition models.
